#	AirBnB (The console)

## Introduction
This project is the initialization of the AirBnb project in the ALX higher lever programming curriculum. It is designed to enable the user perform operations directly from the command line. The server side configuration of the AirBnb begins from here.

Application of python OOP, JSON serialization and deserialization encompasses the entirety of the project. The file storage engine (local disk) is used for the storage and retrieval of users data. 

## The Console
The ```console``` is a major part of the project.

### Start the console
The prompt ```(hbnb)``` is displayed on running the ```console.py``` module. ```help``` displays the list of commands that are in the module
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):

(hbnb)
```

### Using commands in the console
When user hits the ```Enter``` key without any argument, the prompt is displayed repeatedly until ```Ctrl + D``` is used or ```quit``` command
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```
